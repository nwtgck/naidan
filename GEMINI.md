# Development Principles

*   **Zod**: Must be used for all data persistence and API communication to ensure safe serialization. Persisted data must maintain backward compatibility.
*   **Strong Typing**: Prefer strict static typing to catch errors at build-time. Avoid `any`.
*   **Language**: English only for source code, UI, and commit messages.
